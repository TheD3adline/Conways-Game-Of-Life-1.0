# Conways-Game-Of-Life-1.0
Finished the basic Java course from programmieren-starten.de

Practice project to consolidate what I've learned there. This is a workshop and part of the C# course
there, I wanted to see if I could translate it to Java to make it work. Humble beginnings...

Update 22.05.22, finished the project, got a nice refresher on OOP and learned a lot about Java's limitations.
Like no full console functionality...
